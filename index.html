        <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
        <p class="elevator-pitch">
          Hello, my name is Emma Farrell. I am currently a senior at Oakland
          University, though I still have a handful of semesters's worth of
          classes left. I transferred to OU from Oakland Community College two
          years ago, and have since changed my major to Information Technology. As
          of right now, I don't have a specialization selected, and am actively
          researching my options to decide what will be best for me. I am very
          interested in coding projects, and hope to hone my skills in my
          remaining time here at OU. I always strive to learn as much as I can,
          and to do as much as I can with what I know! To learn more about me,
          check out my <a href="./html/my_resume.html">Resume</a> and
          <a href="./html/my_fun_facts.html">Fun Facts</a> pages.
